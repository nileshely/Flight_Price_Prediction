# Flight Fare Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze historical flight data and build a machine learning model to predict flight ticket prices. Flight fares depend on factors such as airline, duration, number of stops, and travel date. This project helps understand these factors and predict prices effectively.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains flight-related information including airline name, source, destination, journey date, departure and arrival times, duration, total stops, and ticket price. It is used for analysis and price prediction.

## Project Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand price patterns  
- Preprocess and clean the dataset  
- Apply feature engineering on date and time variables  
- Build and compare multiple machine learning models  
- Identify the best performing model  

## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R2 Score  

## Conclusion
The project successfully analyzes flight fare data and identifies key price influencing factors. Among all models, Random Forest Regressor performed the best. The model can help predict future flight prices and assist users in planning their journeys.
